## **Abstract**

The **web development domain** plays an essential role in the modern digital ecosystem, yet the **coherent integration** of all components required to build a complete application remains an ongoing challenge.

This paper proposes a **modular architecture**, structured into five functional levels:

- **AI**
- **Front-end**
- **Back-end**
- **Database**
- **Deployment**

The aim is to demonstrate how **scalable**, **reactive**, and **extensible applications** can be developed within a **distributed infrastructure**.

For each level, **well-established technologies** have been selected, with an emphasis on modern principles such as:

- **Reactivity**
- **Asynchrony**
- **Containerization**
- **Automated orchestration**

The architecture is supported by a **fully developed practical implementation** that faithfully reflects the theoretical concepts and offers significant original contributions. Notable features include:

- An advanced **multi-layer caching strategy**
- A **semantic search system** based on vector embeddings
- A **real-time notification mechanism**
- Integration of **AI components** for automatic content generation and **natural-language querying**

In the absence of standard implementations that address the proposed architecture’s requirements, these solutions were **custom developed** to meet the application’s needs.

The contribution of this paper is the **validation of a complete, adaptable, and extensible architectural and conceptual model**. This model is not only applicable to web contexts but also adaptable to a variety of **software development environments**, serving as a **best-practice guide** for designing and implementing **modern distributed systems**.
